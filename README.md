# Supermarket-Management-System
This project was created to design a desktop-based prototype application which will simulate a Supermarket management system.

The application will involve various functionalities which a consumer as well as an administrator/ employee can use and benefit from. 
1. For the consumer, they will be able to create their own account in which they can create a new order by buying from a list of predefined items, update their existing orders, view their order history, and view a specific order they had placed in the past.
2. On the employee side, the application will support functionalities according to the type of employee. For regular  employees, they will be able to log in their working hours (start and end time) on any specific date. For administrators, they will supervise the regular staff and will be able to register newer employees in the database not to forget can also log their own working hours. 
3. There will be one more specific type of employee called the ‘Inventory Manager’ who will be responsible for keeping track of the items sold by the supermarket. This 
inventory manager will decide if the supermarket should sell newer items, restock their existing items, remove/ stop the selling of a particular item.
